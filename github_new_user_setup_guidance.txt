Hello!

You've asked for guidance on setting up a new GitHub account ("8Shahid8") for your project, ensuring that your personal information is not visible in the project's commits. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps.

---

**New GitHub Account Details:**
*   **Username:** 8Shahid8
*   **Email:** shahid35-377@diu.edu.bd
*   **Suggested SSH Key Name:** id_ed25519_shahid
*   **Suggested SSH Host Alias:** github.com-shahid

---

**Step 1: Generate a new SSH key for 8Shahid8**

This step creates a unique SSH key pair (a pair of keys: a private key and a public key) for your new GitHub account.

1.  **Open your terminal (PowerShell, Git Bash, or CMD).**
2.  **Run the following command:**
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "shahid35-377@diu.edu.bd" -f "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519_shahid"
    ```
    *   `-t ed25519`: Specifies the encryption algorithm.
    *   `-C "shahid35-377@diu.edu.bd"`: Adds a comment to the public key, usually the email associated with the account.
    *   `-f "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519_shahid"`: Specifies the file path and name for your new SSH key. It will be saved in your `.ssh` directory.

3.  **When prompted:**
    *   `Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):` It's highly recommended to enter a strong passphrase for security. Remember this passphrase!
    *   `Enter same passphrase again:` Re-enter your passphrase.

After this, two files will be created in `C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\`:
*   `id_ed25519_shahid` (your private key)
*   `id_ed25519_shahid.pub` (your public key)

---

**Step 2: Add the new SSH key to your SSH agent**

The SSH agent manages your SSH keys and passphrases, so you don't have to enter your passphrase every time you use the key.

1.  **Start the SSH agent (if not already running):**
    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```
    *(Note: On some systems, `ssh-agent` might already be running. If you get a message like "Agent pid XXXX", it's already active.)*

2.  **Add your new private key to the agent:**
    ```bash
    ssh-add "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519_shahid"
    ```
    If you set a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter it now.

---

**Step 3: Add the new public key to your GitHub account ("8Shahid8")**

You need to tell GitHub about your new public key so it can authenticate you using it.

1.  **Copy your public key to your clipboard:**
    ```bash
    Get-Content "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519_shahid.pub" | Set-Clipboard
    ```
    *(This command uses PowerShell to read the public key file and put its content into your clipboard.)*

2.  **Go to GitHub.com and log in to the "8Shahid8" account.**
3.  **Navigate to Settings:** Click your profile picture (top right), then select "Settings".
4.  **Go to "SSH and GPG keys":** In the left sidebar, click "SSH and GPG keys".
5.  **Click "New SSH key"** or "Add SSH key".
6.  **Provide a Title:** Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Project Assignment Key" or "8Shahid8 Key").
7.  **Paste the Key:** Paste the content you copied from your clipboard into the "Key" field.
8.  **Click "Add SSH key".**

---

**Step 4: Configure your SSH client for the new GitHub account**

This step tells your computer to use the correct SSH key when interacting with GitHub for your project.

1.  **Open your `.ssh/config` file:**
    ```bash
    notepad "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config"
    ```
    *(If the file doesn't exist, Notepad will ask if you want to create it. Click Yes.)*

2.  **Add the following block to the end of the `config` file:**
    ```
    # Config for 8Shahid8 project account
    Host github.com-shahid
      HostName github.com
      User git
      IdentityFile "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519_shahid"
      IdentitiesOnly yes
    ```
    *   `Host github.com-shahid`: This is the alias you'll use in your Git remote URLs.
    *   `HostName github.com`: The actual GitHub domain.
    *   `User git`: The standard SSH user for GitHub.
    *   `IdentityFile ...`: Points to your new private key.
    *   `IdentitiesOnly yes`: Ensures only this specific key is used for this host.

3.  **Save and close the `config` file.**

---

**Step 5: Configure your local Git repository for the new project**

This final step ensures that your commits are attributed to the "8Shahid8" account and that Git uses the correct SSH configuration when pushing/pulling.

1.  **Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal:**
    *(Replace `E:\2025\CyberSec\SWE\Final Project\safehands` with the actual path to your project folder.)*
    ```bash
    cd "E:\2025\CyberSec\SWE\Final Project\safehands"
    ```

2.  **Set the local Git user name and email for this specific project:**
    *(This will override any global Git configurations for this project only.)*
    ```bash
    git config user.name "8Shahid8"
    git config user.email "shahid35-377@diu.edu.bd"
    ```

3.  **Update the remote URL of your Git repository:**
    *(This tells Git to use the `github.com-shahid` host alias you configured in your `.ssh/config` file.)*
    ```bash
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com-shahid:8Shahid8/SWE_FInalProject.git
    ```
    *   **Important**: Replace `8Shahid8/SWE_FInalProject.git` with the actual path to *your new project's repository* on GitHub, under the "8Shahid8" account.

---

**Verification (Optional but Recommended):**

You can test your SSH connection to the new GitHub host alias:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com-shahid
```
You should see a message like: `Hi 8Shahid8! You've successfully authenticated...`

You can also check the local Git configuration for your project:
```bash
git config --list
```
This should show `user.name=8Shahid8` and `user.email=shahid35-377@diu.edu.bd`.
